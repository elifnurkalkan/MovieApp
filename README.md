## Description

I used The Movie Database (TMDB) API (https://www.themoviedb.org/) for this project.
With this application, you can see movies, search for the movie you want and find information about the movie.

## Features

1.A user should be able to search a movie name and see related results.

2.A user should be able to click on a 'More Info' button and see related information about movie.

3.A user should be able to see the details such as name, rate, primary info, release-date, original language and popularity belonging to the selected movie.
